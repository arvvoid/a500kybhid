# Amiga 500 Keyboard to USB (HID)

[![Build Arduino Leonardo Kyb](https://github.com/arvvoid/a500kybhid/actions/workflows/verify.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/arvvoid/a500kybhid/actions/workflows/verify.yml)

By following the provided instructions, you can retrofit the Amiga 500 keyboard for modern applications while preserving its unique layout and feel.

This was developed and tested with an original Amiga 500 keyboard and an Arduino Leonardo board.
Other combinations are not tested, other boards based on the ATmega32U4 microcontroller should work (wiring might need to be adapted).

I own only an Amiga 500 (Mitsumi) keyboard, so I can't test other models, but other protocol-compatible models should work fine (500/1000/2000), though wiring (and/or keymap) might need to be adjusted.

For a demonstration of the original Amiga 500 keyboard in action, visit the [Amiga Undead GitHub repository](https://github.com/arvvoid/amiga.undead).

## Amiga 500 Keyboard Layout

![Amiga 500 Keyboard Layout](https://wiki.amigaos.net/w/images/7/79/DevFig7-1.png)

Credit: [AmigaOS Wiki](https://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/Keyboard_Device)

## Responsiveness

Average from key press to release in normal use: ~66 ms

Mostly due to the old membrane keys themselves. Keys have long travel time and need some force in the press. There is lot of variability for this reason.

Minimum natural key press/release i achieved is: ~20 ms (very light press/tap to reduce key travel time)

Worst was: ~398 ms (heavy strong key press)

## Help Key Special Functions

The **Help** key on the Amiga 500 keyboard is used as a modifier in this implementation, enabling additional functions when combined with other keys. Below are the available combinations and their corresponding functions.

| Key Combination               | Function                |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Help + F1**                 | F11                    |
| **Help + F2**                 | F12                    |
| **Help + Ptr Sc** (on numpad) | Print Screen           |
| **Help + 0**      (on numpad) | Insert                 |
| **Help + F3**                 | Record macro           |
| **Help + F4**                 | Save macro             |
| **Help + F5**                 | Toggle looping macro   |
| **Help + R**                  | Toggle robot macro mode|
| **Help + Backspace**          | Stop all playing macros       |
| **Help + Del**                | Reset all macros (delete all) |
| **Help + F6**                 | Play macro slot 1      |
| **Help + F7**                 | Play macro slot 2      |
| **Help + F8**                 | Play macro slot 3      |
| **Help + F9**                 | Play macro slot 4      |
| **Help + F10**                | Play macro slot 5      |

| Key Combination (Multimedia)  | Function                |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Help + Arrow Up**           | Volume Up               |
| **Help + Arrow Down**         | Volume Down             |
| **Help + Arrow Right**        | Next Track              |
| **Help + Arrow Left**         | Previous Track          |
| **Help + Enter**              | Play/Pause              |
| **Help + Space**              | Stop                    |
| **Help + M**                  | Mute                    |

### NumLock

When **NumLock** is turned **off**, the following keys on the numeric keypad function as navigation keys by default:
- **Insert**, **Delete**, **Home**, **End**, **Page Up**, and **Page Down**.
- The **arrow keys** on the numeric keypad (2, 4, 6, and 8) also function as cursor movement keys.

With **NumLock** turned **on**, these keys will function as standard numeric keys instead.

## Macro Recording and Playback Guide

This section explains how to use the macro recording and playback functionality of the Amiga 500 Keyboard to USB HID Converter. Macros allow you to record a sequence of key presses and play them back with a single key combination.

### Macro Slots

There are 5 macro slots available, each capable of storing up to 32 key events. The macros are stored in EEPROM, so they persist across power cycles.
32 to keep withing the EEPROM 1kb size of the Leonardo. If you disable persistent macros flag you can larger macros per slot but macros will not persist power cycles.

### **Recording a Macro**

1. **Start Recording**:
   - Press **Help + F3** to begin recording a macro.
   - Normal key presses will be temporarily blocked until you select a recording slot.

2. **Select a Recording Slot**:
   - Press one of the keys **F6** to **F10** to choose a recording slot (slots 1 to 5).
   - After selecting a slot, the keyboard will function normally, but every key press will be recorded until the slot is full or you stop recording.

3. **Stop Recording**:
   - Press **Help + F4** to stop recording and save the macro in the selected slot.

### **Playing a Macro**

1. **Play a Macro**:
   - Press **Help + F6** to **Help + F10** to play the macro stored in the corresponding slot (slots 1 to 5).
   - The macro will replay the recorded key presses/releases with the original timing by default.
   - If Robot Macro Mode is on (toggle with **HELP + R**), the macro is played with minimal interval between key events.

2. **Activate Looping**:
   - Press **Help + F5** to toggle looping mode for macros.
   - When looping is active:
     - A macro will repeat continuously once started.
     - You can deactivate looping mode to allow other macros to play just once.
   - To stop a looping macro, press the corresponding slot key again (e.g., **Help + F6**) while the macro is playing.
   - **Note:** Running too many loops with many key presses may interfere with normal keyboard functionality and introduce delays to standard key presses. Use with caution.

3. **Stop All Macros**:
   - Press **Help + Backspace** to stop all currently playing macros.

### Resetting Macros

1. **Reset Macros**:
   - Press **Help + Del** to stop any playing macro and reset all macros. WARNING this cleans and reset the EEPROM.

### Example Usage

1. **Recording a Macro**:
   - Press **Help + F3** to start recording.
   - Press **F6** to select slot 1.
   - Type the sequence of keys you want to record.
   - Press **Help + F4** to stop recording and save the macro.

2. **Playing a Macro**:
   - Press **Help + F6** to play the macro stored in slot 1.

### Notes

- Macros are stored in EEPROM, so they will persist across power cycles.
- Each macro slot can store up to 32 key events.
- The recording will stop automatically if the macro slot is full.

# Build and Upload Guide

This guide will help you compile and upload the Amiga 500 Keyboard converter code to an Arduino Leonardo. Choose between the **Arduino CLI** (for command-line users) or the **Arduino IDE** (beginner-friendly) to get started.

     ```sh
     make install-core
     ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Install the required libraries:
     ```sh
     make install-libraries
     ```

4. **Update Cores and Libraries**:

- Joystick functionality is experimental and lightly tested.

## TODO

- [ ] Add an optional Piezo Buzzer to the Leonardo for audio feedback, providing better user experience during macro recording.
